# Customer Churn & Lifetime Value Prediction (End-to-End Data Science Project)

## 1. Business Problem

Customer churn is a major driver of revenue loss in subscription-based and consumer businesses. 
This project aims to build a data-driven solution to:

- Predict customer churn probability
- Estimate customer lifetime value (CLV)
- Support retention and marketing decision-making

The solution is designed to be production-ready, enabling integration with downstream systems via APIs.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Identify key drivers of customer churn
- Build and evaluate predictive models for churn
- Design features aligned with real-world customer behavior
- Deploy the final model as an API for consumption by product and marketing teams

---

## 3. Dataset

The project uses a publicly available customer dataset (Telco-style churn data), containing:

- Customer demographics
- Subscription and usage behavior
- Billing and payment information
- Churn labels

The dataset was chosen to reflect common challenges in real-world customer analytics, including:
- Mixed data types
- Class imbalance
- Feature quality issues

---

## 4. Approach Overview

The project follows an end-to-end data science lifecycle:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data quality assessment
2. Feature engineering based on customer behavior and lifecycle concepts
3. Baseline statistical and machine learning models
4. Model evaluation and comparison
5. Model deployment via API
6. Experiment tracking and versioning

---

## 5. Tech Stack

- **Programming:** Python
- **Data Analysis:** pandas, numpy
- **Statistics & ML:** scikit-learn, statsmodels, PyTorch
- **Experiment Tracking:** MLflow
- **API:** FastAPI
- **Containerisation:** Docker
- **Cloud:** AWS (S3, Lambda, API Gateway)

---

## 6. Valuation Metrics

Model performance is evaluated using:

- ROC-AUC
- Precision / Recall
- F1-score

Metrics were selected to balance business impact and model reliability, considering class imbalance.
